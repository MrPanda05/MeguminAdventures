# MeguminAdventures
Megmumin adventures is a shitty rpg game that I did in high school with my friends, its not good, but butter than postal 3 and hunt down the freeman. I do pretend to remake this game in unity.

This rep consisty of mostly a arquive of this old game... I don't have the last version, but you can get it very easy, just make the main character die and then you are good to go!
